# Hey 👋 I’m Vishal

I’m a hands-on engineer with a **founding-CTO mindset**, currently based in **India**, building real-world systems where **embedded hardware, robotics, and edge AI** come together.

I enjoy living close to the metal - firmware, electronics, control systems and pushing intelligence onto devices that have real constraints. My work usually starts with messy real-world requirements and ends with systems that are reliable, maintainable, and actually ship.

---

## What I Do Now
I’m currently working at **EyeROV** as **Senior Manager – R&D**, leading and building systems across:
- Embedded firmware & hardware platforms
- Robotics and underwater systems
- Sensor-heavy architectures and control loops
- Edge AI integrations for real deployments

A big part of my role is making sure ideas move cleanly from **concept → prototype → field-ready product**.

---

## What I Work On
- Embedded system design (bring-up to production)
- Robotics platforms (ROVs, autonomous & sensor-driven systems)
- On-device AI/ML (edge inference, optimization)
- Architecture decisions that balance performance, cost, and long-term sanity
- Translating research ideas into deployable engineering

---

## Tools & Tech I’m Comfortable With

### Embedded & Hardware
STM32, ESP32, RP2040, NVIDIA Jetson  
Bare-metal & FreeRTOS  
I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, PWM  
IMUs, depth sensors, cameras, custom sensor stacks

### Robotics
ArduPilot / ArduSub  
MAVLink  
ROS / ROS2  
Control systems, navigation, system integration

### Edge AI
TensorFlow Lite / TFLite Micro  
PyTorch (training → deployment)  
OpenCV  
Quantization & optimization for constrained hardware

### Software & Systems
C / C++ / Python  
Linux  
Git, CI/CD  
Docker (mostly for ML workflows)

---

## Background (Short Version)
I’ve spent the last several years working across **embedded systems, robotics, and applied AI**, including:
- A PhD focused on **powered prosthetics and control systems**
- Aerospace-grade embedded development (flight software & sensor systems)
- Research work with 9+ peer-reviewed publications
- Leading R&D teams building real products

My bias has always been toward **systems that work outside the lab**.

---

## What You’ll See Here
I’m actively shaping this GitHub into a practical portfolio of:
- Embedded & edge-AI reference implementations
- Robotics and control experiments
- Custom extensions and tools (especially around ArduPilot / ArduSub)
- Notes and patterns I reuse across projects and teams

Expect pragmatic code, not throwaway demos.

---

## Outside of Work
When I’m not debugging hardware or tuning control loops:
- I aquascape planted tanks (@bobosaquaworld)
- 3D print and prototype ideas
- Sketch, animate, and occasionally pick up a guitar

## Find Me Elsewhere
- 🌐 Website: https://vishalr.net  
- 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/vbotics  

If you’re building something involving **robotics, embedded systems, or edge intelligence**, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.
